## Kitchen Assistant - Overview
We are creating a recipe website that allows users to seamlessly share and view recipes. Users will also be able to select recipes,
build grocery lists and then send those grocery lists, through our website, to stores such as Walmart and Kroger. This will integrate
recipes with grocery shopping.

## Tech Stack
We are using PHP as the backend language with the Laravel framework. We are using a mySQL database.
For the frontend, we are using typescript with react. Composer will manage our backend libraries and 
node will manage our frontend libraries.

## Goals
This has been an ongoing product some of my coworkers have been working on
Together:
- We want to be able to use our website to purchase groceries from Kroger by the end of the semester
Individual
- I am joining this project later so I want to understand the codebase
- make meaningful updates
- be in a position to continue working on this project after this semester ends
