## Learning
One of the biggest things I learned was the difficulty and power of working with a team. Because there are four of us, and one of us has professional experience, the codebase was always changing
This meant I often had to understand the changes and update and debug my configurations as the PHP versions, libraries, and workflows changed. This added some overhead to making changes. Github relieved some of these collaboration
challenges, but not all. Despite this, the codebase made massive improvements, becoming better structured, gaining more features, and becoming better tested. More progress was made together than alone. <br>

I have also learned Typescript and React better.
### Key Learning
- Teamwork on a large project
- React with Typescript
- PHP configurations and extensions

## AI
Although we do not use AI in our website, we have used AI to help write some of our test cases and debug various functions

## Why this Project
This website started as the passion project of one of my coworkers. I have interest in this project as I feel it will help me cook healthier and better plan my meals. 
This is something I have struggled with as a busy college student. I feel this product will be extremely useful. It is also fun to build something new with friends.

## Technologies
- PHP Laravel Framework with a mySQL backend
- Authentication uses a combination of a users mySQL table and built in utilities for Laravel
- React with Typescript for the frontend
